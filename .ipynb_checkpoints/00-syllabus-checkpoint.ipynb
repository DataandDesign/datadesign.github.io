    "\n",
    "![](images/logo.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**INSTRUCTOR**: Jacob Frias Koehler, PhD\n",
    "\n",
    "**LOCATION**: 6 East 16th Street room 611\n",
    "\n",
    "**COURSE REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/jfkoehler/data-and-design\n",
    "\n",
    "**SLACK CHANNEL**: https://newschool-math.slack.com/data-and-design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, students should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use computation as a tool to enhance their liberal arts education—to better analyze, communicate, create and learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. gain a broader understanding of the historical and social factors leading to the rise of coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. work through the social and political implications of/embedded within computational technologies and develop an accompanying ethical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. think critically about the ways they and others interact with computation including understanding its limits from philosophical, logical, mathematical and public policy perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "5. engage in project-based and collaborative learning that utilizes computational/algorithmic thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. understand the intrinsic relationship between the physical world, analog environments and digital experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with three different applications using Python.  First, we will use Python to investigate and visualize datasets.  Next, we will develop a simple web application using Flask.  Finally, we will build an interactive data driven web application program using Dash.  Each section will have a component assignment that will build towards your final project; an interactive web application using a dataset of your choice.\n",

    "## Resources \n",
    "\n",
    "The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:\n",
    "- University Libraries: http://library.newschool.edu\n",
    "- University Learning Center: http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center \n",
    "- University Disabilities Service: www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/  \n",
    "\n",
    "In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Student Ombuds: http://www.newschool.edu/intercultural-support/ombuds/\n",
    "The Student Ombuds office provides students assistance in resolving conflicts, disputes or complaints on an informal basis. This office is independent, neutral, and confidential. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Honesty and Integrity \n",
    "\n",
    "Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university. \n",
    "\n",
    "Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found at http://www.newschool.edu/policies/\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the Learning Center’s website: \n",
    "http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/avoiding-plagiarism.pdf\n",
    "[Additional college-specific standards for what constitutes academic dishonesty may be included here.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Intellectual Property Rights: http://www.newschool.edu/provost/accreditation-policies/\n",
    "Grade Policies: http://www.newschool.edu/registrar/academic-policies/ \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attendance\n",
    "\n",
    "“Absences may justify some grade reduction and a total of four absences mandate a reduction of one letter grade for the course. More than four absences mandate a failing grade for the course, unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as the following: \n",
    "an extended illness requiring hospitalization or visit to a physician (with documentation); a family emergency, e.g. serious illness (with written explanation); observance of a religious holiday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attendance and lateness policies are enforced as of the first day of classes for all registered students. If registered during the first week of the add/drop period, the student is responsible for any missed assignments and coursework. \n",
    "\n",
    "For significant lateness, the instructor may consider the tardiness as an absence for the day. Students failing a course due to attendance should consult with an academic advisor to discuss options. Divisional and/or departmental/program policies serve as minimal guidelines, but policies may contain additional elements determined by the faculty member.” Please note: Writing Faculty have a slightly different policy, please check with your chair.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responsibility **\n",
    "\n",
    "Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late papers, failure to complete the readings assigned for class discussion, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions and presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Participation **\n",
    "\n",
    "Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Course Ratings**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide feedback for each of their courses through an online survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys. Instructions are available online at http://www.newschool.edu/provost/course-evaluations-student-instructions.pdf. \n",
