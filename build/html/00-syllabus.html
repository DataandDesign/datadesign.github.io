<h2>Learning Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#Learning-Objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>use computation as a tool to enhance their liberal arts education—to
better analyze, communicate, create and learn.</li>
<li>gain a broader understanding of the historical and social factors
leading to the rise of coding.</li>
<li>work through the social and political implications of/embedded within
computational technologies and develop an accompanying ethical
framework.</li>
<li>think critically about the ways they and others interact with
computation including understanding its limits from philosophical,
logical, mathematical and public policy perspectives</li>
<li>engage in project-based and collaborative learning that utilizes
computational/algorithmic thinking.</li>
<li>understand the intrinsic relationship between the physical world,
analog environments and digital experiences</li>
</ol>

<p>We will work with three different applications using Python. First, we
will use Python to investigate and visualize datasets. Next, we will
develop a simple web application using Flask. Finally, we will build an
interactive data driven web application program using Dash. Each section
will have a component assignment that will build towards your final
project; an interactive web application using a dataset of your choice.</p>

<h2>Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#Resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic
and artistic excellence. These resources include: - University
Libraries: <a class="reference external" href="http://library.newschool.edu">http://library.newschool.edu</a> - University Learning Center:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center">http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center</a> - University Disabilities
Service: www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/</p>
<p>In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for
students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs
academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All
conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any
accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service
(SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will
provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring
to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss
these accommodations in relation to this course.</p>
<p>Student Ombuds: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newschool.edu/intercultural-support/ombuds/">http://www.newschool.edu/intercultural-support/ombuds/</a>
The Student Ombuds office provides students assistance in resolving
conflicts, disputes or complaints on an informal basis. This office is
independent, neutral, and confidential.</p>
<div class="section" id="Academic-Honesty-and-Integrity">
<h3>Academic Honesty and Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#Academic-Honesty-and-Integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences,
including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of
the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary
probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the
university.</p>
<p>Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on
academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of
sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their
work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility
of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for
correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of
others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures,
is found at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newschool.edu/policies/">http://www.newschool.edu/policies/</a></p>
<p>Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found
on the Learning Center’s website:

dishonesty may be included here.]</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="Attendance">
<h3>Attendance<a class="headerlink" href="#Attendance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>“Absences may justify some grade reduction and a total of four absences
mandate a reduction of one letter grade for the course. More than four
absences mandate a failing grade for the course, unless there are
extenuating circumstances, such as the following: an extended illness
requiring hospitalization or visit to a physician (with documentation);
a family emergency, e.g. serious illness (with written explanation);
observance of a religious holiday.</p>
<p>The attendance and lateness policies are enforced as of the first day of
classes for all registered students. If registered during the first week
of the add/drop period, the student is responsible for any missed
assignments and coursework.</p>
<p>For significant lateness, the instructor may consider the tardiness as
an absence for the day. Students failing a course due to attendance
should consult with an academic advisor to discuss options. Divisional
and/or departmental/program policies serve as minimal guidelines, but
policies may contain additional elements determined by the faculty
member.” Please note: Writing Faculty have a slightly different policy,
please check with your chair.</p>
<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a>Responsibility **</p>
<p>Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.
Late papers, failure to complete the readings assigned for class
discussion, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions and
presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.</p>
<p><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">**</span></a>Participation **</p>
<p>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping
up with reading, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active
participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.</p>
<p><strong>Student Course Ratings</strong></p>
<p>During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide
feedback for each of their courses through an online survey. They cannot
view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so.
Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the
learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable
data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to
both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating
surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can
understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching
students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future.
Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to
reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In
addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review
course surveys. Instructions are available online at
